## Description  and Information
In Tanzania, climate-sensitive waterborne diseases such as typhoid, amoebiasis, diarrhoea, schistosomiasis, and intestinal worms pose significant health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations like women and children. These diseases are exacerbated by poor water quality, inadequate sanitation, and changing climate patterns, disproportionately affecting communities with limited access to healthcare. With a region in Tanzania as a focus, the lack of predictive tools hinders timely interventions, leaving these populations at greater risk.

The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the outbreaks of climate-sensitive waterborne diseases. Using datasets comprising water sources, toilet quality, waste management, health facility data, and climate information from 2019 to 2023.

This predictive capability will enable governments and health organisations to implement timely, targeted interventions and optimize resource allocation, ultimately reducing disease incidence and enhancing public health resilience.

As part of this challenge, data from the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) will be used. ASDI is Amazonâ€™s tech-for-good program that is helping researchers, scientists, and innovators around the world advance their work on sustainability-related research, including climate change. The program provides publicly-available access to important scientific data on AWS that can be otherwise hard for researchers to access or analyse.

This is one of two winning projects supported by the AI For Equity Challenge, in partnership with IRCAI and AWS. Sokoine University of Agriculture will have support from AWS to implement and deploy the solutions developed during this challenge
